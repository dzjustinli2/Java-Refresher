StringCode
---------- 

String blowup(String str)

Returns a version of the original string as follows: each digit 0-9 that appears in the original string is replaced by that many occurrences of the character to the right of the digit. So the string "a3tx2z" yields "attttxzzz" and "12x" yields "2xxx". A digit not followed by a character (i.e., at the end of the string) is replaced by nothing.

CharGrid

The CharGrid class encapsulates a 2d char array with a couple operations.
